                    <p class="aboutTxt">My name is Jonathan Cunningham. I am currently attending Southwest Baptist University as a senior. I am studying computer science and mathematics. I found my love for coding and problem solving through game development. I started when I was a freshman in highschool and have been programming ever since.</p>
                    <p class="aboutTxt">The thing that motivates most of my projects is essentially the cool factor. I learn new things and spend countless hours on projects because I think the project would be cool and fun to do. I also love a good challenge. I love complex, hard problems that I can spend many hours trying to solve. I see myself as a professional problem solver at the end of the day. I prefer to solve problems in a game dev context but any problem solving is very enjoyable to me.</p>        
                    <p class="aboutTxt">I have a massive grave yard of dead projects that will never see the light of day, as many developers do. However I have archived a few projects here that I feel have been completed enough to show off! You can go check those out in the projects page. </p>
