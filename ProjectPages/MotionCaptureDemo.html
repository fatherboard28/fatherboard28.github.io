            <h2> About </h2>

            <p>
                This was a contract I was a part of. The project goal was to figure out a way to make a game that utilizes a webcam to control an avatar on screen that must dodge falling objects and objects being thrown from the side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I unfortunately was not able to come up with a viable solution. I did not know enough about realtime motion capture algorithms that could solve this problem. I did learn a lot about how some of this technology works and how it could integrate with Unity.
            </p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>
                There are two takeaways from this project. The first was how to realistically evaluate my skills and abilities as a developer. Knowing my current skills and what I am capable of doing in a limited amount of time is a skill I have come to highly value. I also learned to be more inquisitive and thorough in researching a problem before attempting to code anything. Finding how it could be solved and evaluating different solutions benefits and drawbacks prior to coding has saved me so much time in the past. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned to save and document all my project after this one. A few months after the project I found my self wishing I had more saved from this project. I do not have any pictures or code left from this except for the one shown here. I wish I had more but I do not but it did teach me to document more on any projects going forward.
