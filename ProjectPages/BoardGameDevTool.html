            <h2> About </h2>

            <p>
                This is a project aimed at reducing the time it takes to create a board-game game space. For example: Mario Party's maps. The project was a success and reduced the time from around two hours for a medium map to just ten minuets.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project features a editor window that allows the creation of gameobject's that contain customizable aspects. You are in complete control of the mesh and materials and name of nodes. The tool allows for the quick creation of different node types with different functionalities. Each node is equipped with a completely auto generated script which includes a method that runs when a player lands on the node. The tool also renders lines between all nodes that are connected.
            </p>

            <p>
                The inspiration for the project came from learning about adjacency matrices. The map is represented by a matrix. Because of this you are able to calculate all nodes that are reachable from any given position and any given distance. This feature was four years in the making. I searched all over the internet for a solution to this problem and never found it until I took Discrete Math in university.
            </p>

            <h2> What I learned </h2>
            <p>
                Through creating this project I learned all about creating editor tools in the Unity Editor. I have come to love the process of creating tools that speed up development time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My understanding of maps was also increased in working on this project. In order to understand a proper solution to my problem I did research into the ways maps work and how professionals use them in games. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scope creep was a rampant problem through out the development of this. I had to learn to say no to many ideas and shiny things to put into the project. I constantly went back to the original problem I had set out to solve.
